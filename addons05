		description="Here's a weird and bright theme called ""Orange"".
Because I like the color orange. And because the other themes are way too ""dark"" if you understand what I mean. ;-)

As the name suggests, it is a theme, where everything is orange and the ""shadow"" is brown.
The blocks, shadow blocks and fragile blocks are square-shaped oranges. They come in four slighlty different variants.
The conveyor belts are represented by an orange peel. :D
The background is colored orange, too. The sun is shining.
The spikes are a shameless rip-off of the Pixel Caslte theme by Tedium, just tinted orange.
""Me"", ""my shadow"", Exit, portal, checkpoint, switch, floor button and the key are just shamelessly copied from the Cloudscape theme by Tedium, just tinted orange. Nothing too special.

This is probably not the final version. I really want to replace the rip-off spikes with something else. I don't know what. Spike oranges? Nah! Not weird enough. :lol:
I don't know if I like the background. Note that the screenshot does not show the entire background.
I probably change some other minor stuff in future, too. Who knows?"
