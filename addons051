Because I like the color orange.
Current version: 3

It's a bright and highly saturated theme in which everything is in the color orange and there are lots of oranges, too! It makes MnMS much more colorful and is a nice change from the stormy and gray “Cloudscape” theme.

The sky is orange and cloudy (it's even animated a bit!), the blocks are oranges, the conveyor belts are orange peels, you are colored orange yourself, … You get the idea. :D
